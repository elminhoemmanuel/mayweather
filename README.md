<!-- OVERVIEW -->

### Important Notice
- Plase note, in order for this web application to work properly live online or locally on your computer you will need to access it on Google chrome web browser preferrably and install this extension found [here](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/moesif-origin-cors-change/digfbfaphojjndkpccljibejjbppifbc) this is to prevent failure when data is being fetched due to CORS error from the [metaweather](https://www.metaweather.com/api/) api which was used. The other fix asides this requires resources which I currently do not have.

- My experience building this was quite exciting as I had the opportunity to flex my love for Redux as this helped me with managing the state of this application effectively during the various data fetching procedures.
